We are regulated by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the Australian government financial intelligence agency responsible for monitoring financial transactions to detect and prevent money laundering, organised crime, tax evasion, welfare fraud, and terrorism financing.
